        If you get high, you’re more likely to get laid.</p>

        Weed smokers have 20% better sex lives than those who don’t smoke, reported a new study in the <a href="http://www.jsm.jsexmed.org/article/S1743-6095%2817%2931417-0/fulltext" target="_blank">Journal of Sexual Medicine</a>.</p>
    <p>
        The study looked at the answers of more than 28,000 women and 23,000 men of reproductive age about their smoking and sex habits over the last four weeks prior to the survey, using data from the National Survey of Family Growth.</p>
    <p>
        According to the study, women who didn't smoke weed reported having sex six times on average during the past four weeks. Women who smoked daily had sex seven times on average. Similarly for men, those who abstained from marijuana said they had sex an
        average of five times in the four weeks before the survey, compared with the daily marijuana users who reported having sex nearly seven times on average.</p>
    <p>
        “Marijuana use is very common, but its large-scale use and association with sexual frequency hasn’t been studied much in a scientific way,” Dr. Michael Eisenberg, the study’s senior author said in a <a href="http://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2017/10/regular-marijuana-use-linked-to-more-sex.html"
            target="_blank">statement</a>.</p>
    <p>
        The study was primarily focused on heterosexual relationships, but was diverse in background, economics, marital status and race.</p>
    <p>
        Despite Eisenberg’s assertion that “frequent marijuana use doesn’t seem to impair sexual motivation or performance,” past studies haven’t been so kind to sexually active weed smokers. One study, also published in the <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1743-6109.2010.02198.x/abstract?userIsAuthenticated=false&amp;deniedAccessCustomisedMessage="
            target="_blank">Journal of Sexual Medicine in 2011</a>, said smoking weed can cause erectile dysfunction.</p>
    <p>
        There is a balance, the study says, between marijuana’s tendancy to increase arousal and its potential consequence of decreasing sperm count.</p>
    <p>
        The study didn’t further explore the connection between the two activities and didn’t take into account whether the weed was smoked right before sex.</p>
