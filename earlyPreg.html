    <p>Symptoms of pregnancy can vary among different women. They may vary in quality or severity, and even the same woman may not experience the same symptoms in every pregnancy. Pregnancy symptoms may also be noticed or begin at different points in the
        pregnancy. </p>
    <p>This article describes the most common symptoms of pregnancy in its early and later stages.<span id="cntid"></span></p>

                <p>Planning for pregnancy typically involves discussions with a woman's partner and her health-care team, and includes discussions about nutrition and vitamins, exercise, genetic counseling, weight gain, and the need to avoid certain medications
                    and alcohol. However, because some women experience light bleeding known as implantation bleeding around the time of the expected menstrual period, or because of irregular menstrual cycles, some women may not realize they are pregnant
                    until specific symptoms of pregnancy start to develop. By this time, the woman may have unknowingly exposed herself to substances that may be harmful for the pregnancy. </p>
                <p>Women who choose to begin pregnancy planning before conception can take steps to ensure that potentially harmful exposures are avoided.</p>

            <h3><span itemprop="alternativeHeadline"><b>16 signs and symptoms</b> of early pregnancy</span></h3>
        </div>
        <p></p>
        <p>A number of symptoms begin in the early <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stages_of_pregnancy_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" class="slidelink" title="Educational Slideshow" target="_blank">stages of pregnancy</a>:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b> Missed (late) menstrual period</b>: A <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/missed_menstrual_period/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">missed menstrual period</a> is the hallmark symptom of pregnancy, and menstruation
                is absent throughout the pregnancy. Sometimes, the mild cramping and spotting experienced at the time of implantation of the fertilized egg in the uterus (see later) can be mistaken for a menstrual period. Women whose menstrual cycles
                are irregular may also not immediately notice the absence of a menstrual period.</li>
            <li><b>Implantation bleeding or cramping:</b> Mild bleeding or spotting may occur when the fertilized egg attaches to the uterine lining, anywhere from 6 to 12 days after <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/ovulation_and_fertility_pictures_slideshow/article.htm"
                    rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" class="slidelink" title="Educational Slideshow" target="_blank">fertilization</a>. Mild cramping can also occur at this time.</li>
            <li><b> Vaginal discharge</b>: Some women may notice a thick,
                <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vaginal_discharge/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">milky discharge from the vagina</a> in early pregnancy. This occurs in the first weeks of pregnancy as the vaginal walls thicken.
                This discharge may occur throughout the pregnancy. If there is an unpleasant odor associated with the discharge, or if it is associated with burning and
                <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/vaginal_itching/symptoms.htm" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" rel="sym">itching</a>, this is a sign of a yeast or bacterial infection. You should contact your health-care professional if this occurs.</li>
            <li><b>Breast changes:</b> Many women experience changes in the breasts as early as the first weeks of pregnancy. These changes can be felt as soreness, tenderness, heaviness, fullness, or a tingling sensation. The discomfort typically decreases
                after several weeks.</li>
            <li><b>Darkening of the areola:</b> The <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/breast_anatomy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">areola</a>, or area around the nipple, may darken in color.</li>
            <li><b>Fatigue</b> While this symptom is very nonspecific and may be related to numerous factors, pregnant women often describe feelings of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/fatigue_and_tiredness/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">fatigue</a>                from the earliest weeks of pregnancy.</li>
            <li><b>Morning sickness/nausea vomiting:</b> This is actually a misnomer because the <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">nausea</a> of pregnancy can occur at any time of day. Some
                women never experience this symptom, while others have severe nausea. Its most typical onset is between the 2nd and 8th weeks of pregnancy. Most women experience relief from the symptoms around the 13th or 14th week, but others may have
                nausea persistent throughout the pregnancy. </li>
            <li>Sensitivity to certain smells: Certain smells may bring on nausea or even <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">vomiting</a> early in pregnancy.</li>
            <li><b>Increased urination:</b> Some women will have more
                <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/frequent_urination/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">frequent urination</a> due to hormonal changes, starting about the 6th to 8th week. If other symptoms occur, such as burning
                on urination, you should see your health care professional to make sure you are not suffering from a urinary tract infection.
            </li>
            <li><b>Dizziness or fainting:</b> Perhaps related to hormonal changes affecting glucose levels or <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/blood_pressure_picture/picture.htm" rel="img" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" class="imglink"
                    title="Medical Image" target="_blank">blood pressure</a>, <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/dizziness_dizzy/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">dizziness</a> and feeling faint can occur in early pregnancy.</li>
            <li><b> Constipation</b>: Hormone levels can also cause some women to have <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/constipation/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">constipation</a> in early pregnancy<b>.</b></li>
            <li><b>Headaches:</b> <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/migraine_headaches_pictures_slideshow/article.htm" rel="slide" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');" class="slidelink" title="Educational Slideshow" target="_blank">Headaches</a>, as well, may
                be related to changing hormone levels and may occur throughout pregnancy.</li>
            <li><b>Food cravings/aversions:</b> Cravings may begin in early pregnancy and may last throughout the pregnancy. Likewise, food aversions (feeling nausea or distaste for a particular food) can also occur. </li>
            <li><b>Back pain:</b> Often considered more a symptom of late pregnancy, low back pain can actually begin in the early stages of pregnancy. Women can experience some degree of <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/low_back_pain/article.htm" rel="dt"
                    onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">back pain</a> throughout pregnancy.</li>
            <li><b>Mood changes:</b> <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/mood_swings/symptoms.htm" rel="sym" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">Mood swings</a> are relatively common during the first trimester of pregnancy due to changing hormone levels. They
                may also be related to <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/stress/article.htm" rel="dt" onclick="wmdTrack('embd-lnk');">stress</a> or other factors.</li>
            <li><b>Shortness of breath:</b> Increased oxygen demand by the body (to support a growing fetus) may leave some women feeling short of breath, although this symptom is more common in later stages of pregnancy.<span id="cntid"></span></li>
