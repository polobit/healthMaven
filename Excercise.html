        <p>TUESDAY, Jan. 2, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- If you're <a href="https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/ss/slideshow-7-most-effective-exercises" data-metrics-link="" data-crosslink-type="slideshow">exercising</a> outdoors this winter, take special
            precautions, a sports medicine expert advises.</p>
        <p>With winter's chill upon us, it's become increasingly important to check the weather conditions -- including the forecast and wind chill -- before starting out. Then, adjust your clothes accordingly, suggested Dr. Theodore Shybut, an assistant
            professor of orthopedic surgery at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.</p>
        <p>Start by dressing in layers. This will keep you warm and let you take off clothing as needed to prevent overheating, Shybut recommended in a Baylor news release.</p>
        <p>"Usually it is OK to feel slightly <a href="https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/default.htm" data-metrics-link="" data-crosslink-type="article">cold</a> when you first step out," he said. "Once you're actually
            <a href="https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/default.htm" data-metrics-link="" data-crosslink-type="article">exercising</a> and warmed up, you're going to generate a lot of heat, so you're trying to find the right amount of clothing.</p>
        <p>"You want to be warm enough so you're not risking <a href="https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/rm-quiz-frostbite-iq" data-metrics-link="" data-crosslink-type="tools">frostbite</a> or any kind of
            <a href="https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/ss/slideshow-cold-or-flu" data-metrics-link="" data-crosslink-type="slideshow">cold</a> injury," Shybut said. "If you're overdressed and you sweat excessively, it's going to waterlog your clothing,
            which will make you colder as your sweat freezes."</p>

        <p>He suggested clothing made of moisture-wicking high-performance fabrics, rather than cotton. Your outer layer should be wind-resistant, or waterproof and breathable if it's raining or snowing.</p>
        <p>Always wear a hat. It's also important to have your hands and <a href="https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/picture-of-the-feet" data-metrics-link="" data-crosslink-type="article">feet</a> properly covered. And, some weather conditions make it
            important to also cover your face and <a href="https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/ear-infection/picture-of-the-ear" data-metrics-link="" data-crosslink-type="article">ears</a>.</p>
        <p>If you plan to be out for a long time, consider carrying an extra set of dry clothing, socks and gloves that you can change into if needed.</p>
        <p>But there's more to think about than clothing.</p>
        <p>Even in cold weather, you're going to lose fluid and will need to hydrate as you normally would, Shybut said.</p>

        <p>Also wear footwear that's appropriate for slippery conditions, he advised. Slow down and be extra careful when changing direction or running on uneven surfaces.</p>
        <p>If you're exercising outdoors at night, wear reflective clothing and a safety light, Shybut recommended. It's also a good idea to wear a headlamp to help you see better.</p>
