                                <p>Changing the way you eat can help you manage the symptoms much better. PCOD symptoms are aggravated with consumption of certain types of foods so staying away from refined flour, sugar, dairy products and carbohydrates
                                    helps to greatly reduce insulin imbalance and associated symptom occurrence. Replacing such foods with raw fruits, green leafy vegetables and foods with a low glycemic index helps to maintain the nutrition value and
                                    also aids weight loss.</p>
